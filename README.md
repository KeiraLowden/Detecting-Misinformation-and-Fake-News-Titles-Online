# Detecting-Misinformation-and-Fake-News-Titles-Online

This repository contains the work for our final project on employing an AI agent to detect misinformation in news headlines. We developed a retrieval-augmented reasoning agent that utilizes TF-IDF search combined with a small Large Language Model (LLM) to classify news headlines. With the spread of misinformation growing rapidly in our society, it is important to not only show the possible societal benefits to AI, but equally as important to provide some sort of aid to those with lower media literacy as they interpret the news they consume. Our core methodology uses a retrieval-augmented classification system based on ReAct (Thought -> Action -> Observation) loops. The model architecture uses an instruction-tuned LLM (Qwen 0.5B/1.5B) to generate reasoning steps and tool calls, while the TF-IDF backend performs search and ranking using cosine-similarity. We trained and evaluated the model on the WELFake Dataset, which consists of approximately 72,000 samples with a balanced binary label distribution (True/Fake). A key design choice was allowing the model to abstain from prediction to improve accuracy and precision, especially in title analysis. The agent demonstrated a strong performance in detecting misinformation (Fake class), achieving an F1 score of 0.78 (precision 0.69, recall 0.89)8. Future work may involve extending the approach to analyze entire articles and applying it to live broadcasts or debates. This work provides a valuable, interpretable step-by-step reasoning model for fake news detection.
